This is the repository for the assignment Simple bridges between 2D GIS and 3D visualization;
Showing a cut of the University of British Columbia with the topography, trees, and buildings 
all being shown in 3D through the use of Qgisthreejs.
The buildings were shown in purple as it is my favorite color, but even after extruding the object type some of the buildings still appeared to be floating. One tweak I would like to make
is to enlargen the radius of the tree spheres because they are quite hard to see
at the recommended radius of 3. 

Hope you enjoy!
