This is the repository for the assignment Simple bridges between 2D GIS and 3D visualization;
Showing a cut of the University of British Columbia with the topography, trees, and buildings 
all being shown in 3D through the use of Qgisthreejs.
The buildings were shown in purple as it is my favorite color and my one tweak I would have made
is to make the radius of the tree spheres larger because they are quite hard to see
at the recommended radius of 3. 

Hope you enjoy!
